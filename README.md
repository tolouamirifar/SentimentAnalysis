# Analyzing Customer’s Sentiments Toward Well Known Brands in Social Networks Using Text Mining Technique

In this research, I used a random sample of data from Twitter to evaluate consumer's sentiment towards well-known cell phone brands. An expert pre-defined lexicon ia applied to assess the daily and the total consumer’s sentiment score. The rate of changes in daily sentiments during a specific period was then compared with the news, which was released during the same time. Other effective factors were analyzed using QDA (Qualitative Data Analysis)
